I am a former Master's Student in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, with a focus in Biomedical Data Science.

I am currently a research assistant in the NeuroData Lab, where I have utilized big data statistical techniques to design, build, study, and apply methodologies aimed at understanding and improving both animal and machine intelligence systems.
